I am from Thai Nguyen, a small city in the north of [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam).  I had more than five years of teaching at [School of Foreign Languages](http://en-sfl.tnu.edu.vn/), [Thai Nguyen University](http://en.tnu.edu.vn/), [Viet Nam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam). I am currently a PhD Candidate at Educational Technology program, [College of Education and Human Sciences](https://education.okstate.edu/), [Oklahoma State University](https://go.okstate.edu/). ***Go POKES!***

Now, I am working as an Instructional Designer to assist online teaching instructors.  During my years of teaching and learning, I am interested in researching, evaluating and integrating new and emerging educational technologies to improve online teaching and learning. My research interest is creating and supporting Online Learning. I invite you to browse my site, learn about my passions and experiences. I hope you can explore your interests as well.
