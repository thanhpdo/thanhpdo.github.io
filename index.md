<p align="center"> Teaching is more than imparing knowledge, it is inspring change. Learning is more than absorbing facts, it is acquiring understanding. </p>
<p align="center"> -William Arthur Ward-  </p>

I am a new graduate with a PhD degree in Learning, Design and Technology, [College of Education and Human Sciences](https://education.okstate.edu/), [Oklahoma State University](https://go.okstate.edu/), class of May 2022.

I am interested in exploring, evaluating, and integrating new and emerging educational technologies to improve online teaching and learning. As a learning professional, I am striving to expand my teaching and learning knowledge and build my experience in instructional design. I realize that I have been interested in educational technology since I was a college student. At that time, I learned how to create PowerPoint presentations for my class assignments. I began my career as an instructor at the School of Foreign Languages, Thai Nguyen University, in my hometown in 2008. During my teaching time, I learned to integrate technologies into classrooms using different software and tools, such as iMovie, Audacity, Google Drive, and DynEd. 

When pursuing my Ph.D. degree, I had great opportunities to apply my knowledge of educational technology to assist online instructors. My major tasks included evaluating online course development and development, and identifying the best methods for creative and engaging instructional materials. I invite you to browse my site, and learn about my passions and experiences. I hope you can explore your interests as well.
