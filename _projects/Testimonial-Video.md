**My Role** Instructional Designer

**Target Audience**  OSDH Employees

**Tool Used** Camtasia and Canva  <br />

**What I Did**
In this project I created a testimonial video to capture participant feedback from recent training programs and to communicate impact to stakeholders. I began by clarifying the key messages we wanted to highlight, such as perceived usefulness, changes in practice, and overall satisfaction. I drafted a set of guiding interview questions, coordinated with participants, and conducted interviews in a way that encouraged authentic, reflective responses. I then selected representative clips, scripted a storyline that connected them, and handled the editing, including basic transitions, captions, and on-screen text to frame the messages. The final video was shared with internal stakeholders as both a communication tool and an informal source of qualitative evaluation data.

**Reflections and Future Improvements**
This project underscored the value of learner and participant voices for demonstrating the real-world effects of instructional design work. I learned that planning for evaluation and storytelling from the outset leads to stronger footage and clearer narratives than trying to “capture something” at the end. In the future, I would like to integrate testimonial collection into a more systematic evaluation plan that includes both quantitative and qualitative evidence. I would also explore creating multiple tailored versions of the video, for example a shorter cut for executive audiences and longer clips that can be used directly in orientations or promotional materials, while ensuring that all media adheres to accessibility standards such as captions, transcripts, and clear audio.
