**My Role** Ph.D. Student

**Target Audience** Edtech students and course instructor

**Tools Used** Visme

**What I Did**
In the course EDTC 5103 – Advanced Computing Applications in Education, I designed a concise infographic to efficiently introduce learners to the concept of Open Educational Resources (OER). This tool selected and simplified five key points—covering what OER are, their benefits, where to find them, the mechanics of licensing, and strategies for quality evaluation—to provide a foundational understanding. To encourage further exploration, the infographic included links or references to OER repositories and examples that students could immediately investigate. Finally, it was strategically integrated into the course materials as a pre-reading assignment or a quick reference tool for activities focused on finding and utilizing OER.

**Reflections & Future Improvements**
The initial infographic successfully demystified the concept of OER and proved highly effective as a reusable reference throughout the course. Moving forward, I plan to enhance its instructional value by creating companion activities where students can immediately apply the learned information, such as using a short checklist (derived directly from the infographic) to evaluate a potential OER. To maximize impact and relevance, my future development efforts will include creating versions of the infographic tailored to different audiences—specifically, one for faculty focused on adoption and another for undergraduate students centered on practical usage. Finally, developing a short interactive or animated version will further increase engagement and ensure broader accessibility across various devices.
