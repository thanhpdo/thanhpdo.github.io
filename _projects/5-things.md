**My Role** Ph.D. Student

**Target Audience** Edtech students and course instructor

**Tools Used** Visme

**What I Did**
Designed a concise infographic to introduce learners to the concept of Open Educational Resources (OER) as part of the course EDTC 5103 – Advanced Computing Applications in Education.
Selected and simplified five key points (e.g., what OER are, benefits, where to find them, how licensing works, how to evaluate quality).
Included links or references to OER repositories and examples that students could explore further.
Integrated the infographic into course materials as a pre-reading or quick reference in activities that involve finding and using OER.

**Reflections & Future Improvements**
The infographic helped demystify OER and served as a reusable reference throughout the course.
In the future, I would create companion activities where students apply the information (e.g., evaluating an OER using a short checklist derived from the infographic).
I would like to develop versions of the infographic tailored to different audiences (e.g., faculty vs. undergraduate students).
A short interactive or animated version could further increase engagement and support accessibility across devices.
