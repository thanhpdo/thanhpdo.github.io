**My Role** Instructor

**Target Audience** ESL students at the School of Foreign Languages, Thai Nguyen University, Viet Nam

**Tools Used** iMovie, Audacity, Google Drive

**What I Did** In this project, I asked ESL students to participate in a video project to express their knowledge of previous lessons. Students had opportunities to practice real situations, and adapt technologies to create fun and informative videos. Students chose a context to produce an 8-10 minute video in a group of four or five students.

*Objectives*
Students will be able to
- Choose a suitable context to perform in their own video
- Shoot, edit, and publish their video

*Requirements*
- Instructor: masters the use of necessary ICT tools to create a video
- Students: have taken the drama project (optional) and the basic ICT course
- Classroom: computers, projector, sound systems, internet connection

*Procedure*
- Introduce the project
- Explain the project requirement
- Choose a context
- Provide sample videos
- Introduce necessary technology tools for making and publishing a video
- Provide evaluation rubric

**Reflections and Future Improvements**
This project reinforced for me how powerful authentic production tasks can be for language learning, motivation, and confidence. I observed that students were more engaged and willing to take risks when the final product felt meaningful and allowed for creative expression. At the same time, I learned that group dynamics and access to technology can significantly influence the experience. If I were to refine this assignment, I would formalize the support around group work by integrating more explicit roles, agreements, and reflection on collaboration. I would also explore offering differentiated pathways for students with limited access to devices or editing software, ensuring that the project remains equitable while still maintaining its project-based and competency-oriented nature.
