title: 'EHA Outreach Faculty Resources'
description: >
  In this project, I designed a resouce course site for the faculty community at the College of Education and Human Sciences, the former name was the College of Education, Health and Aviation, for online teaching. The first version of this course site was created in Brightspace by D2L, since March 2018. I then moved this course site to Canvas when Oklahoma State University switched to Canvas LMS in Spring 2019.
