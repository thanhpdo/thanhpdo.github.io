**My Role** Instructional Designer

**Target Audience** Faculty who teach online at the College of Education and Human Sciences

**Tools Used** Canvas LMS

**What I Did** In this project, I designed a resouce course site for the faculty community at the College of Education and Human Sciences, the former name was the College of Education, Health and Aviation, for online teaching. The first version of this course site was created in Brightspace by D2L, since March 2018. I then moved this course site to Canvas when Oklahoma State University switched to Canvas LMS in Spring 2019.

 I began by mapping out key competency areas such as course planning, content organization, communication strategies, engagement techniques, assessment and feedback, and accessibility. Using principles of backward design, I organized the course into clear modules, each with a short overview, specific learning objectives for faculty, curated readings or videos, and downloadable templates or checklists. I created or adapted guides on topics such as aligning objectives, activities, and assessments, building discussion prompts, and using LMS tools effectively. Throughout the design, I paid attention to navigation and cognitive load, using consistent headings, chunking content into small sections, and offering multiple formats whenever possible.
 
I created the front page to introduce the course site. I listed the main content in this page.

I used pages to provide information for main sessions, such as Online Course Development Process and Online Instruction Best Practice.

I also organized main contents into categories in Modules

**Reflections and Future Improvements**
This resource course reinforced the importance of designing for faculty as adult learners who also have diverse preferences, time constraints, and prior experiences with technology. I saw how a well-structured course can reduce friction and make it easier for instructors to find what they need at the moment they need it. If I were to enhance this project, I would incorporate more interactive elements such as short self-check quizzes, branching scenarios, or reflective prompts that allow faculty to apply ideas to their specific courses. I would also like to implement a simple analytics or feedback mechanism to monitor which pages and resources are used most frequently, then use that data to refine the structure, retire low-value content, and identify gaps where new materials are needed.
