**My Role** Instructional Designer

**Target Audience** Faculty at the College of Education and Human Sciences

**Tool Used** Google Drive, Canva, Zoom

**What I Did**
I followed suggestions on teaching remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic by Milman (2020) to create a project plan. Besides, by personal communication with some online faculty I used to assist, I selected important tips and designed a simple document that contains one set of Tips each week. The weekly tip series addressed a range of tips and strategies in categories, including online presentation tools, assessments, engagement activities, and interactive activities. With the help of my supervisor, we reviewed, edited, and sent out the document weekly to all faculty in the whole semester.

In this project, I also applied the ADDIE model to organize and develop the content. With this project, I received the Nova Southeastern Univ. Award for Outstanding Practice by a Graduate Student from the Division of Design and Development, the Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT)

The list of essential topics that relate to online teaching:

- Video Presentation
- Using Canvas Studio
- Engagement Activities
- Checking Attendance in a Zoom Meeting
- Online Presentation Tools
- Virtual Office Hours
- Synchronous Zoom Sessions
- Interactive Activities Using Zoom’s Annotate
- Assessments

This project was highly evaluated by faculty and administrators for some reasons. Firstly, this project aimed to respond to emergency remote teaching, which is “a temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate delivery mode due to crisis circumstances” (Hodges et al., 2020). Secondly, the design of the materials was simple, easy to follow. Thirdly, the materials contained essential information to assist faculty who taught online for the first time. Fourthly, we delivered the materials promptly everyweek, so the faculty had enough time to read and implement the tips and strategies. And finally, I set up time slots for the faculty to schedule an instant appointment if they need my assistance in applying the tips.

**Reflections and Future Improvements**
Through this project I learned how valuable concise, well-curated guidance can be when faculty are overloaded with information and time-pressed. The ADDIE structure helped me stay organized and intentional, but the most critical insight came from listening carefully to faculty and adjusting topics based on their evolving needs. If I were to extend or redesign this work, I would formalize the evaluation component by building in short feedback surveys with each tip, tracking which topics lead to the most implementation, and using that data to prioritize future content. I would also consider converting selected tips into short video microlearning segments with captions and transcripts to further support Universal Design for Learning and multiple means of representation.
