title: 'Online Teaching Tips - Using the ADDIE model'
description: >
   Following the suggestions on teaching remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic by Milman (2020), I planned and developed this project during Fall 2020 to provide instant guidance to all EHS College faculty. In this project, I also applied the ADDIE model to organize and develop the content. With this project, I received the Nova Southeastern Univ. Award for Outstanding Practice by a Graduate Student from the Division of Design and Development, the Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT)

**My role** Instructional Designer

**Target Audience** Faculty at the College of Education and Human Sciences

**Tool Used** Google Drive, Canva, Zoom

I followed suggestions on teaching remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic by Milman (2020) to create a project plan. Besides, by personal communication with some online faculty I used to assist, I selected important tips and designed a simple document that contains one set of Tips each week. The weekly tip series addressed a range of tips and strategies in categories, including online presentation tools, assessments, engagement activities, and interactive activities. With the help of my supervisor, we reviewed, edited, and sent out the document weekly to all faculty in the whole semester.

The list of essential topics that relate to online teaching:

- Video Presentation
- Using Canvas Studio
- Engagement Activities
- Checking Attendance in a Zoom Meeting
- Online Presentation Tools
- Virtual Office Hours
- Synchronous Zoom Sessions
- Interactive Activities Using Zoom’s Annotate
- Assessments

This project was highly evaluated by faculty and administrators for some reasons. Firstly, this project aimed to respond to emergency remote teaching, which is “a temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate delivery mode due to crisis circumstances” (Hodges et al., 2020). Secondly, the design of the materials was simple, easy to follow. Thirdly, the materials contained essential information to assist faculty who taught online for the first time. Fourthly, we delivered the materials promptly everyweek, so the faculty had enough time to read and implement the tips and strategies. And finally, I set up time slots for the faculty to schedule an instant appointment if they need my assistance in applying the tips.
