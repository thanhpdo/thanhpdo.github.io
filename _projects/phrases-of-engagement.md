**My Role** Instructional Designer

**Target Audience** Online Instructors at College of Education and Human Sciences, OSU

**Tool Used** Canva

**What I Did**
In this project I developed an infographic that visualizes different phases of student engagement in online courses and offers concrete examples of activities appropriate to each phase. I drew on engagement and online learning literature to identify a simple, intuitive progression that instructors could quickly understand. I then translated these ideas into a visual format, selecting a muted color palette and clear typography that aligns with my overall academic brand. For each phase, I included short descriptions and example strategies such as early icebreakers, ongoing discussion prompts, collaborative projects, and reflective wrap-up activities. The goal was to create a resource that could be glanced at quickly but also serve as a reference when planning or revising an online course.

**Reflections and Future Improvements**
Through this project I learned how valuable concise, well-curated guidance can be when faculty are overloaded with information and time-pressed. The ADDIE structure helped me stay organized and intentional, but the most critical insight came from listening carefully to faculty and adjusting topics based on their evolving needs. If I were to extend or redesign this work, I would formalize the evaluation component by building in short feedback surveys with each tip, tracking which topics lead to the most implementation, and using that data to prioritize future content. I would also consider converting selected tips into short video microlearning segments with captions and transcripts to further support Universal Design for Learning and multiple means of representation.
