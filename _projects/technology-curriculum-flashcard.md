The following box contains different terms that relate to technology and curriculum. You can choose your own style to play:
 
After selecting the Flashcards mode icon, the first definition will appear. By default, Quizlet flashcards display definitions first. To change this setting, click the Options button and select Start with term. Navigate through the flashcards using the arrow buttons below the card or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. To automate card progression, click the Play button, and Quizlet will cycle through them automatically. Enabling Shuffle will display the cards in a random order, and it can be used independently or alongside the Play feature.
