**Tool used** Quizlet
The following box contains different terms that relate to technology and curriculum. You can choose your own style to play:
 
After you click on the Flashcards mode icon, you'll see the first definition. The Flashcards created via Quizlet show definitions first by default. So, if you want to change this, click on the Options button, then Start with term. 
To advance to the next card, use the arrow buttons below the card, or use the right and left arrow keys on your keyboard.
If you don't want to advance your cards manually! Click on the Play button, Quizlet will cycle through your flashcards automatically. If you click on Shuffle, they'll be displayed in random order. Shuffle can be used with or without Play enabled, and vice versa.
