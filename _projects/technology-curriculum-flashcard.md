**My Role** Ph.D Student

**Tool Used** Quizlet

**Target Audience** EFL students at the School of Foreign Languages, Thai Nguyen University, Vietnam

**What I Did**
In this activity I designed a set of interactive vocabulary resources using Quizlet to help learners master key terms related to technology and curriculum. I began by selecting terms that are foundational for understanding course readings and discussions, then writing clear, concise definitions aligned with how the terms are used in the program. I built these into Quizlet sets, taking advantage of multiple activity modes such as flashcards, matching, and practice tests so learners could review in different ways. I introduced the resource early in the term, showed students how to access and use it, and encouraged them to return to it as a self-paced tool for review before quizzes, discussions, or projects.
The following box contains different terms that relate to technology and curriculum. You can choose your own style to play:
 
After selecting the Flashcards mode icon, the first definition will appear. By default, Quizlet flashcards display definitions first. To change this setting, click the **Options** button and select **Start** with term. Navigate through the flashcards using the arrow buttons below the card or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. To automate card progression, click the **Play** button, and Quizlet will cycle through them automatically. Enabling **Shuffle** will display the cards in a random order, and it can be used independently or alongside the Play feature.

**Reflections and Future Improvements**
Through this work I saw how useful interactive vocabulary tools can be for lowering cognitive load and supporting students who may be encountering specialized terminology in a second language or for the first time. I also noticed that usage patterns vary; some students use the tool consistently while others forget it exists once the initial novelty wears off. In the future, I would more intentionally integrate the Quizlet sets into course activities, for example by referencing them directly in assignments or creating short in-class or online games that rely on the same terms. I would also like to gather more systematic feedback from students about which terms are still confusing and adjust the sets accordingly, possibly adding example sentences or brief contextual notes for terms that are frequently misused.
