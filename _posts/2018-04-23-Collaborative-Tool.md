## Collaborative Tool

One of the collaborative tools I like is Nearpod

How it will be used by me and the students: I will prepare some discussion slides that students can post their opinions. Moreover, students will have opportunities to review what they have learn by using their own words. 

Why the tool was chosen: I discover that nearpod not only is a platform for me to present the lesson, but it provides interactive options. I think this is a good way to collaborate students and learning. Moreover, the activity will provide me information about students to see whether they follow and understand my presentation or not.

​

​How the experience of utilizing the tool will enhance student learning: students can show their understandings and express their learning ability. Students will feel excited to explore the upcoming slides/ activities. Students can see the results of discussion activity and can learn from other students.

​
How you will determine if its use was successful or justifies: this interactive tool allows me to create a quick survey to collect students' reflections about the effectiveness of collaborating this technology tool into the lesson. Determining the value of the tool will provide me some suggestions for future lessons.
